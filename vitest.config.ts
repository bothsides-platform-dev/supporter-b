// Step 14 — Vitest workspace projects.
//
// Two projects share resolve/plugins/setup but pick the right environment per
// test surface. `pnpm test` runs both; `pnpm test --project=unit-node` (or
// `unit-jsdom`) scopes to one for faster local iteration.
//
//   - unit-node    : DB/server/integrations/auth/api routes — `environment: node`
//                    (heavy postgres-js / pglite / fs work that fights jsdom)
//   - unit-jsdom   : React component + hook surface — `environment: jsdom`
//
// `app/api/files/__tests__/*` files self-declare `@vitest-environment node` via
// pragma. Leaving the pragma harmless after the project split — defense in
// depth if someone later moves the file or the include pattern drifts.
//
// We deliberately do NOT set `plugins`/`resolve` at the root: without
// `extends: true` on each project, root entries are inert. Each project
// declares its own (identical) config — explicit > spooky inheritance.
